Built around the Hindi proverb 'those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,' the track methodically narrates how SOS joined Azadi, copied SM's flow, made a diss against their own labelmates while asking the label to fund it, and allegedly leaked women's private photos without consent. The song concludes with a real voice clip of Azadi co-founder Mo Joshi corroborating SM's version of events and dismissing SOS as 'two insecure little pricks.'"
