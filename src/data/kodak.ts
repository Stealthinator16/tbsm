King delivers a braggadocious verse about wild nights and stolen girlfriends, Calm tells a reflective story about a Hauz Khas party girl who transforms into a settled family woman over nine years, and Encore ABJ narrates an intimate yet emotionally detached one-night encounter where he wrestles with casual desire and self-preservation."
