Calm's verse paints a vivid picture of the rapper life -- waking up late, ordering Swiggy, watching Naruto, gaming on PS4, and dominating stages across India while keeping a tight inner circle. Encore ABJ's verse goes deeper, reflecting on coming from nothing in Delhi NCR, navigating scene politics, dealing with jealous haters, and drawing parallels to Akatsuki's pain, all while affirming that fame hasn't changed who they are and that nobody in the scene matches their skill."
