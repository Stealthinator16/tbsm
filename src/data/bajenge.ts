The track blends Encore's smooth flirtation, Calm's introspective moments about authenticity beneath the party surface, and Badshah's braggadocious verses comparing himself to legendary poets while embracing hedonistic nightlife. It's a celebration of desi identity, Delhi nightlife, and the shared cure of partying through stress."
