  "summary": "\"Nevermind\" is a landmark cross-border collaboration featuring Talha Anjum (Young Stunners, Karachi) and Calm (Seedhe Maut, Delhi), bridging the India-Pakistan hip-hop divide. Talha Anjum opens with rapid-fire flexes and American hip-hop references before switching to Punjabi to dismiss rival rappers, while Calm delivers an aggressive verse packed with intricate 'kala' wordplay and cricket metaphors celebrating the Sindh-Ganges connection. The track is a statement piece that treats the Indo-Pak collab as breaking news, with both artists asserting their dominance over the South Asian rap scene."
