  "summary": "\"Bhussi\" is a cinematic storytelling track from Seedhe Maut's collaboration with KSHMR and Karan Kanchan, narrating a grocery store robbery that goes fatally wrong when an accidental gunshot kills the shopkeeper. Through vivid street-level detail, the song explores how poverty and desperation push people into crime, with the duo painting unflinching portraits of Delhi's underbelly — from drug-fueled bravado to the hollow realization that money numbs shame but never erases it."
