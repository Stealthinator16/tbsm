  "summary": "\"Roshni\" is a collaboration between Seedhe Maut and Ritviz, produced by Sickflip, that explores themes of existential uncertainty, emotional suppression, and the search for light amidst inner emptiness. Encore's verse delves into how societal expectations (sanskaar) and the weight of hopes crush individuality, leaving one hollow, while Calm narrates the story of someone navigating jealousy, isolation, and unspoken pain. The song's hypnotic hook by Ritviz ties it all together with the recurring metaphor of roshni (light) as something fleeting yet worth seeking."
