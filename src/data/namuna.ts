  "summary": "\"NAMUNA\" is an aggressive track by Seedhe Maut where the duo asserts their dominance over the Indian hip-hop scene, dismissing rivals as 'namune' (specimens/clowns). Calm flexes his winning habits and wordplay while both members deliver a rapid-fire sequence of rhetorical questions challenging who's truly iconic, before pivoting into a surprisingly introspective stretch about the common man's struggle — referencing political wordplay and Premchand's literary legacy. Encore ABJ closes the track with his signature aggression, declaring SM's shadow inescapable."
